        <h2>🚀 Voitta.ai - AI-Powered Analytics Platform for Financial Professionals</h2>
        <p class="project-meta">2024-Present</p>
        <p>
          Building next-generation analytics platform that transforms how quantitative analysts, risk managers, and portfolio managers interact with data—accelerating time-to-insight from weeks to hours without requiring software engineering expertise.
        </p>

        <h3>"Vibe Coding" Interface</h3>
        <p>
          Revolutionary natural language approach to financial modeling. Users describe complex analyses in plain English—"create a scatter plot showing how market makers set bid-ask spreads over time" or "calculate 95% VaR with expected shortfall visualization"—and Voitta generates production-quality Python code, executes analysis, and produces publication-ready visualizations instantly.
        </p>

        <h3>Interactive Model Building</h3>
        <p>
          Real-time validation of model assumptions with live parameter adjustment and scenario analysis. Eliminates traditional code-compile-debug cycles that consume 70% of quantitative analysts' time. Enables rapid iteration for stress testing, regulatory reporting, and model validation—critical for meeting compliance deadlines.
        </p>

        <h3>Enterprise Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Seamless connectivity with existing financial infrastructure including major LLM platforms (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama), data warehouses (S3, Snowflake, SQL), HPC clusters (Spark, Hive), and proprietary internal systems. Designed for regulated environments with SSO, user management, and workspace versioning.
        </p>

        <h3>Target Impact</h3>
