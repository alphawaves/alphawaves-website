      <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
      <p>Your organization has invested years—maybe decades—building the systems that run your business. ERPs, data warehouses, analytics platforms, custom applications. They work. Your teams know them. Your processes depend on them.</p>
      <p>Now AI is here, and everyone's asking the same question: <strong>How do we use it without breaking what already works?</strong></p>
      <p>Most AI vendors want to sell you a new platform. We don't. We integrate AI into your existing infrastructure—extending its capabilities, not replacing it.</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">We bring the power of Large Language Models to your legacy systems.</p>

      <div class="capability">
        <h3>Natural Language Interfaces</h3>
        <p>Let your teams query databases, generate reports, and control applications using plain English.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="capability">
        <h3>Intelligent Automation</h3>
        <p>Automate complex workflows that previously required manual intervention or specialized knowledge.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="capability">
        <h3>Data Science Acceleration</h3>
        <p>Reduce analysis time from days to minutes with AI-assisted exploration and visualization.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="capability">
        <h3>Enterprise-Grade Security</h3>
        <p>Your data stays on your infrastructure. We integrate AI without compromising security or compliance.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Shift We're Living Through</h2>
      <p>Think about when Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals. It wasn't just a notation change—it made complex mathematics possible. Suddenly, problems that were impossibly tedious became tractable. Modern science emerged.</p>
      <p>LLMs represent a similar cognitive shift. For the first time, humans can communicate with computer systems in natural language—not code, not specialized query syntax, not arcane commands. Just language.</p>
      <p><strong>We've mastered this new language. And we specialize in connecting it to the systems you already depend on.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>We use AI in our own work. Every engagement benefits from the same tools and techniques we deploy for clients. We're not just integrators—we're practitioners who use AI daily to accelerate analysis, automate workflows, and deliver faster.</p>
      <p>This means we understand the real-world challenges: what works, what doesn't, and what it takes to move from demo to production.</p>
