      <p class="intro">Alphawaves Consulting helps enterprises harness AI without abandoning the infrastructure they've built.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We believe AI's greatest impact comes not from replacing existing systems, but from making them more accessible and more capable.</p>
      <p>For decades, computing has evolved along three parallel tracks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Code Creators</strong> — Engineers writing in Python, SQL, JavaScript, and other programming languages</li>
        <li><strong>Data Specialists</strong> — Analysts working with structured information: financial records, operations data, customer insights</li>
        <li><strong>Business Users</strong> — Operators who need systems to work but shouldn't need programming expertise to use them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These groups have always spoken different languages. Code creators write algorithms. Data specialists wield query languages and statistical tools. Business users navigate interfaces designed by the other two groups—often with friction.</p>
      <p><strong>LLMs change this.</strong> For the first time, we have a common language that all three groups can use to interact with computer systems. The promise of AI isn't just automation—it's universal accessibility.</p>

      <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>

      <div class="differentiator">
        <h3>Integration, Not Replacement</h3>
        <p>We don't ask you to abandon working systems. We extend them. Your ERP, your data warehouse, your analytics stack—they become the foundation for AI-enhanced capabilities, not obstacles to overcome.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="differentiator">
        <h3>Practitioners First</h3>
        <p>We use AI in everything we do. Our analysis workflows are AI-assisted. Our development processes leverage LLMs. We don't just talk about AI transformation—we live it daily. This practitioner mindset means we understand real-world constraints and can deliver solutions that actually work in production.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="differentiator">
        <h3>Bleeding Edge, Battle Tested</h3>
        <p>We stay at the frontier of LLM technology—new models, new techniques, new integration patterns—but we only deploy what's proven reliable. Innovation without stability isn't useful. We give you both.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="differentiator">
        <h3>Security by Design</h3>
        <p>Enterprise data is sensitive. We architect solutions where your data never leaves your infrastructure. AI capabilities are brought to your environment—your data doesn't go to the cloud unless you choose it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <div class="approach-steps">
        <div class="step">
          <span class="step-label">Understand</span>
          <p>We map your existing systems, data flows, and user workflows. No solution works without this foundation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <span class="step-label">Design</span>
          <p>We architect AI integration points that extend capabilities without disrupting operations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <span class="step-label">Demonstrate</span>
          <p>We build working prototypes—not slide decks—to prove value before scaling.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <span class="step-label">Deploy</span>
          <p>We implement production-ready solutions with the documentation, training, and support your team needs.</p>
